# Oracle Bet

Oracle Bet is a decentralized prediction market built on Solana.

The goal is simple: allow users to create markets, trade outcomes, and settle results in a transparent and trust-minimized way, while keeping the system fast, composable, and cost-efficient.

Oracle Bet is designed with a modular architecture:
- On-chain programs handle core market logic and settlement
- Off-chain services handle indexing, data access, and performance
- A clean interface connects traders, market creators, and liquidity
